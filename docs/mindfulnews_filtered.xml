EU spokesperson Anitta Hipper reiterated the bloc’s commitment to peace, calling for continued pressure for a ceasefire.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Middle East, the longstanding conflict between Israel and Gaza is poised at a critical juncture. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a security cabinet meeting amid escalating tensions. Media reports suggest a potential expansion of military operations, with discussions around a broader Israeli occupation of Gaza. This decision remains under consideration, as the region faces a potential change with far-reaching consequences.</p><p>Israeli forces have already advanced into central Gaza, though it remains unclear if this marks the beginning of a larger military push.

          <p>As we experience the height of summer in many parts of the world, a series of environmental events underscores the vital importance of addressing climate change and its impacts on our planet. Stretching from wildfires in North America to record-breaking temperatures in Asia, and further affecting the biodiversity in Australia, each incident provides a profound reminder of the Earth's interconnected ecosystems.</p><p>In North America, the air quality has become a pressing concern as wildfires continue to blaze across Canada and parts of the United States. These fires have led to smoke drifting over vast areas, prompting air quality alerts in fourteen states, from the Great Lakes to the northeastern regions. The impact on visibility was significant enough to cause a ground stop at Boston's Logan International Airport. Cities like Detroit, New York City, and Chicago have ranked among the top locations worldwide with the poorest air quality. The ongoing situation highlights the need for enhanced fire management systems and strategies to mitigate air pollution.</p><p>Turning our attention to Asia, Japan and South Korea are enduring unprecedented heatwaves. Japan recently recorded its highest temperature to date at 41.2°C in Tamba, with numerous local records shattered across the country, including in Kyoto. Similarly, South Korea is experiencing a notably warm summer, with Seoul witnessing 22 consecutive nights with temperatures over 25°C. These temperature extremes, breaking records for multiple consecutive years, emphasize the evolving climate patterns that demand adaptation and resilience from nations, while spurring global efforts to curtail emissions and temperature rise.</p><p>In another part of the world, the Great Barrier Reef stands as a stark indicator of ongoing environmental stress. For the first time since the 1980s, the famed reef has suffered its largest annual reduction in live coral in two of its three main areas. A comprehensive report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science attributes this decline to the mass coral bleaching event of early 2024, the most widespread and severe on record. There is concern about the reef’s ability to recover between catastrophic events, indicating the urgent need for conservation initiatives as well as global climate action.</p><p>Moreover, in Europe, the Languedoc region in France is grappling with rapidly spreading wildfires. Over a thousand hectares have been scorched, necessitating the deployment of 750 firefighters, supported by aerial resources such as Canadairs and helicopters. This reinforces the propensity for rapid wildfire spread under favorable conditions, leading to the deployment of significant resources to control such outbreaks.</p><p>Further north in Finland, an unexpected consequence of the record heatwave has been its impact on reindeer. These arctic animals, well adapted to the cold, find themselves unable to regulate their body temperature amidst the unusual warmth, leading to unfortunate fatalities. This serves as a poignant example of how species are affected differently by climate anomalies, calling attention to the broader implications of temperature fluctuations on wildlife.</p><p>The compounded effects of these events serve as a potent reminder of the pervasive influence of climate change across the globe. While challenges are evident, the collective response—through technology, policy advocacy, and community resilience—brings hope. Efforts to improve air quality monitoring, enhance energy efficiency, and fortify natural habitats against climate-induced threats are more critical than ever. As nations collaborate and innovate, our shared goal remains safeguarding the planet for future generations. Through informed action and global solidarity, there lies a promising path towards a sustainable future.</p>

          <p>In recent times, the global health landscape has been shaped by numerous challenges, each demanding a thoughtful and coordinated response. As we navigate these complexities, two prominent issues stand out: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare professionals and the ongoing efforts to control the spread of diseases such as Mpox in various regions. These issues not only highlight the vulnerabilities within our health systems but also underscore the resilience and dedication of those on the frontlines.</p><p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals have faced immense pressures, with their mental health bearing the brunt of such demanding conditions.

          <p>In recent times, the global health landscape has been shaped by numerous challenges, each demanding a thoughtful and coordinated response. As we navigate these complexities, two prominent issues stand out: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare professionals and the ongoing efforts to control the spread of diseases such as Mpox in various regions. These issues not only highlight the vulnerabilities within our health systems but also underscore the resilience and dedication of those on the frontlines.</p><p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals have faced immense pressures, with their mental health bearing the brunt of such demanding conditions.

          <p>In a rapidly evolving global landscape, recent developments have brought social awareness, educational reforms, and political shifts into focus. These important topics showcase the dynamic interplay between societal needs and governmental responses, offering opportunities for reflection and positive change.</p><p>In China, a rare public protest has captured attention, spotlighting social concerns and the power of collective voice. In the city of Jiangyou, Sichuan province, large crowds have gathered in response to a distressing incident—video footage circulated online depicting the beating of a young girl by three teenagers. The incident caused widespread outrage, prompting citizens to take to the streets. Such public demonstrations are uncommon in China, where expressions of dissent are typically discouraged. Nevertheless, this particular protest highlights the deep-seated desire for justice and societal protection, signaling the potential for greater attention to individual rights and communal harmony.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Australia, the government faces calls for urgent educational reforms. The focus is on the Morrison-era "job-ready" university graduates scheme, which has come under criticism for allegedly increasing costs for arts and law subjects while reducing fees for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses. Labor MPs are urging the Albanese government to prioritize rectifying the scheme, arguing that it has not served the interests of students effectively. These calls for reform represent a broader parliamentary push to ensure higher education is equitable and responsive to the diverse needs of students, guaranteeing that graduates are well-prepared for the complexities of the modern workforce.</p><p>On the political front, Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, marks its centenary, reflecting on its history and future challenges. Under the leadership of Rhun ap Iorwerth, the party emphasizes its commitment to core values amidst changing political tides. Ap Iorwerth speaks of Plaid Cymru's readiness to offer a fresh and ambitious approach in the forthcoming Senedd elections. With Wales poised for potential political reorientation, Plaid Cymru is striving to present solutions to pressing issues such as long waiting lists and cost-of-living concerns, aiming to deliver leadership that resonates with the electorate's aspirations.</p><p>Furthermore, a recent poll has shed light on public attitudes toward immigration policies in the UK. Findings suggest that almost half of the voters support strict immigration controls, including curbing new entries and requiring recent migrants to leave. This data underscores the influence of public perception on policy preferences, often shaped by understanding—or lack thereof—of migration realities. The ongoing discourse around immigration reflects a broader dialogue on national identity, cultural inclusivity, and economic imperatives.</p><p>These global updates underscore a unifying theme: the critical role of civic engagement and responsive governance in addressing current societal challenges. Whether through public protests advocating for justice, or governmental initiatives striving for educational fairness, the evolving narrative emphasizes collaboration, awareness, and progress as pathways to a harmonious and inclusive future.</p>

          <img alt="" class="article-image" src="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/05/13231379.jpg" />
          <p>In recent developments from the international scene, a blend of unexpected reactions, strategic business decisions, and evolving tourism policies have captured attention. These stories reflect the dynamic nature of global interactions and highlight how various sectors are navigating the shifting landscapes.</p><p>In the realm of international trade, the European Commission has expressed a sense of surprise at the criticism from Germany regarding a trade deal between the European Union and the United States. Despite Germany's long-standing support for the EU's strategic approach to international trade negotiations, recent comments have suggested a divergence in expectations or priorities. Such discussions, while complex, aim to refine the nuances of agreements that significantly influence economic partnerships across the Atlantic. The collaborative spirit, vital for these negotiations, continues to drive efforts toward harmoniously meeting the needs and priorities of all involved parties.</p><p>Meanwhile, New Zealand has announced plans to introduce fees for international tourists visiting some of its most cherished natural sites. Set to be implemented by 2027, this initiative forms part of a broader overhaul of conservation laws aimed at balancing preservation with sustainable growth. The proposal includes a fee ranging from NZ$20-40 per visitor, targeting iconic destinations such as Cathedral Cove, Tongariro Crossing, Milford Sound, and Aoraki Mount Cook. By charging these fees, New Zealand hopes to generate funds to maintain the pristine environments that attract millions each year, while also allowing for responsible development on conservation land. This approach underscores New Zealand's commitment to protecting its unique natural heritage while accommodating the economic benefits of tourism.</p><p>In the business sector, significant movements are taking shape, with the Australian investment firm Macquarie Group reportedly poised to acquire a 40% stake in Luz Saúde, one of Portugal's prominent healthcare providers. This transaction, which values Luz Saúde at approximately one billion euros, highlights the ongoing trend of international investments flowing into the European healthcare market. Such investments are indicative of a broader strategy among global investors to diversify portfolios and capitalize on the growth potential presented by health services industries. By fostering collaboration across borders, these investments contribute to the enhancement of healthcare standards and access.</p><p>Further in the aviation industry, Lufthansa, the renowned German airline group, has decided to withdraw from potential investment and stakeholding plans in Air Europa, a Spanish airline. After careful evaluation and negotiations, Lufthansa concluded that moving forward with the transaction was not aligned with its strategic interests. This decision leaves Turkish Airlines as the remaining contender for a potential partnership with Air Europa. Such strategic decisions are not uncommon in the highly competitive airline industry, where companies are continuously reshaping their portfolios to optimize business performance and leverage new opportunities. The decision may redirect Lufthansa's focus towards other promising avenues, potentially within the Portuguese market.</p><p>In sports, touching on the personal and professional growth within this sector, former footballer Marco Caneira reflects on the positive influence of Jorge Costa during his career. Caneira shares how Costa's leadership helped many young players develop, leading by example and nurturing a supportive environment. These memories highlight the importance of mentorship in sports and the broader impact it can have on athletes' careers and personal development.</p><p>These stories collectively paint a picture of a world in motion, where decisions, policies, and personal journeys interweave to shape our global community. While challenges are inevitable, the overarching narrative is one of careful consideration, strategic planning, and a shared commitment to growth and sustainability. As these developments unfold, they serve as reminders of the interconnectedness that defines contemporary global relations and the thoughtful strategies that guide them.</p>

          <p>In recent developments from the international scene, a blend of unexpected reactions, strategic business decisions, and evolving tourism policies have captured attention. These stories reflect the dynamic nature of global interactions and highlight how various sectors are navigating the shifting landscapes.</p><p>In the realm of international trade, the European Commission has expressed a sense of surprise at the criticism from Germany regarding a trade deal between the European Union and the United States. Despite Germany's long-standing support for the EU's strategic approach to international trade negotiations, recent comments have suggested a divergence in expectations or priorities. Such discussions, while complex, aim to refine the nuances of agreements that significantly influence economic partnerships across the Atlantic. The collaborative spirit, vital for these negotiations, continues to drive efforts toward harmoniously meeting the needs and priorities of all involved parties.</p><p>Meanwhile, New Zealand has announced plans to introduce fees for international tourists visiting some of its most cherished natural sites. Set to be implemented by 2027, this initiative forms part of a broader overhaul of conservation laws aimed at balancing preservation with sustainable growth. The proposal includes a fee ranging from NZ$20-40 per visitor, targeting iconic destinations such as Cathedral Cove, Tongariro Crossing, Milford Sound, and Aoraki Mount Cook. By charging these fees, New Zealand hopes to generate funds to maintain the pristine environments that attract millions each year, while also allowing for responsible development on conservation land. This approach underscores New Zealand's commitment to protecting its unique natural heritage while accommodating the economic benefits of tourism.</p><p>In the business sector, significant movements are taking shape, with the Australian investment firm Macquarie Group reportedly poised to acquire a 40% stake in Luz Saúde, one of Portugal's prominent healthcare providers. This transaction, which values Luz Saúde at approximately one billion euros, highlights the ongoing trend of international investments flowing into the European healthcare market. Such investments are indicative of a broader strategy among global investors to diversify portfolios and capitalize on the growth potential presented by health services industries. By fostering collaboration across borders, these investments contribute to the enhancement of healthcare standards and access.</p><p>Further in the aviation industry, Lufthansa, the renowned German airline group, has decided to withdraw from potential investment and stakeholding plans in Air Europa, a Spanish airline. After careful evaluation and negotiations, Lufthansa concluded that moving forward with the transaction was not aligned with its strategic interests. This decision leaves Turkish Airlines as the remaining contender for a potential partnership with Air Europa. Such strategic decisions are not uncommon in the highly competitive airline industry, where companies are continuously reshaping their portfolios to optimize business performance and leverage new opportunities. The decision may redirect Lufthansa's focus towards other promising avenues, potentially within the Portuguese market.</p><p>In sports, touching on the personal and professional growth within this sector, former footballer Marco Caneira reflects on the positive influence of Jorge Costa during his career. Caneira shares how Costa's leadership helped many young players develop, leading by example and nurturing a supportive environment. These memories highlight the importance of mentorship in sports and the broader impact it can have on athletes' careers and personal development.</p><p>These stories collectively paint a picture of a world in motion, where decisions, policies, and personal journeys interweave to shape our global community. While challenges are inevitable, the overarching narrative is one of careful consideration, strategic planning, and a shared commitment to growth and sustainability. As these developments unfold, they serve as reminders of the interconnectedness that defines contemporary global relations and the thoughtful strategies that guide them.</p>

          <p>In recent developments across the globe, a series of initiatives are bringing attention to the plight and potential solutions for people affected by migration policies, housing shortages, and expedition tragedies. Each highlight underscores a commitment to addressing these complex issues with thoughtful strategies and compassion.</p><p>In a significant move, Rwanda has agreed to accept up to 250 migrants from the United States. This agreement follows previous US deportation actions to other third countries, such as South Sudan and Eswatini, under the Trump administration's migration policies. Although details regarding the criteria for selection and transfer of these migrants remain under wraps, this decision reflects Rwanda's role in international humanitarian efforts. By welcoming these individuals, Rwanda is providing a potential refuge and new beginnings for those who have faced numerous challenges in their quest for stability. The broader implications of such agreements underscore the interconnectedness of global communities addressing migration and resettlement.</p><p>Turning to West Africa, the government of Guinea-Bissau has embarked on a transformative initiative to construct 1,500 social housing units. The vision expressed by Adolfo Ramos, a government representative, highlights a desire to modernize the country by improving living conditions, particularly in Bissau and its surrounding areas. Many residences in the region are currently deemed precarious, and this project aims to elevate the country's image, offering safer and more dignified housing solutions for its citizens. By investing in infrastructure and housing, Guinea-Bissau is prioritizing the well-being of its residents—laying a foundation not just for physical structures but for future economic and social growth.</p><p>In another realm of global attention, the tragic events surrounding the Titan submersible continue to be a subject of reflection. Operated by OceanGate Expeditions, the Titan embarked on a mission to explore the Titanic's shipwreck but met with a catastrophic end due to a critical implosion. As investigations continue, the primary responsibility has been attributed to the operating company. While the mission aimed to peek into the historical past buried undersea, the incident reminds us of the delicate balance between human exploration and safety. Such events serve as sober reminders to continually assess and improve risk management practices in the realm of exploration, as the pursuit of knowledge must align with the highest standards of safety and care.</p><p>Back in the housing domain, a call to action has arisen from the political party, Livre, urging governing bodies to address the risks of eviction facing many citizens. With growing economic pressures and disparities between income levels and rental costs, Livre has emphasized the need for a comprehensive review of financial support systems. The entity proposes that adjustments be made to reflect current housing market conditions, thus ensuring adequate assistance for individuals at risk of losing their homes. This appeal for intervention signifies a critical need for responsive and adaptive policies that support vulnerable populations while reinforcing the importance of shelter as a fundamental human right.</p><p>Together, these initiatives and developments from various corners of the world emphasize a shared human experience—using empathy, innovation, and policy to tackle pressing challenges. Whether through housing construction, migration accommodation, reflective safety protocols, or review of socioeconomic support systems, an underlying current flows with the intention of enhancing life and fostering communities that thrive. As these stories unfold, they invite us to ponder deeper on the commonalities that link us and the collective steps we can take toward solutions grounded in conscientious care and solidarity.</p>

          <p>In a world where stories of history, politics, and personal experiences intertwine, recent events provide a glimpse into the diverse threads that shape our shared existence. From the depths beneath Rome to the intricate political landscapes of Moldova, and the heartfelt connections between families separated by geopolitical tensions, these stories invite us to reflect on our collective journey.</p><p>Beneath the bustling streets of Rome’s Piazza Venezia, an archaeological treasure has emerged, shedding light on the lives of working-class Romans during the early empire. As construction teams delve into the city’s historic heart to expand the Metro C underground line, they have uncovered the remains of what appears to be a multistorey complex of homes and shops. These relics offer invaluable insights into the everyday lives of those who once thrived in the heart of ancient Rome, enriching our understanding of a civilization built on the contributions of ordinary people. This discovery stands as a testament to the hidden histories waiting to be unearthed beneath our feet, fostering a deeper appreciation for the layers of time that shape our present.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the geopolitical arena, Moldova has witnessed a significant judicial decision with the sentencing of Yevgenia Gutsul, a pro-Russia regional leader, to seven years in prison. This case marks a pivotal moment in the nation’s legal landscape, as Gutsul was convicted of funneling undeclared Russian funds to finance the now-banned Șor party. This party, founded by Ilan Shor, a businessman in exile, had sought to exert pro-Moscow influence within Moldova. The ruling underscores the country's complex relationship with Russia and highlights the delicate balance Moldova navigates in its political alignments. As developments unfold, the implications of this case may resonate further, contributing to the broader discourse on sovereignty and influence in Eastern Europe.</p><p>On the familial front, a poignant moment of connection has occurred as Joe Bennett, for the first time in 213 days, spoke with his mother, Lindsay Foreman, who, along with her husband Craig, is detained in Iran. Charged with espionage, the couple was apprehended in the city of Kerman while traversing the country on a global motorbike journey. Despite the challenging circumstances, the conversation brought immense joy and relief, likened by Bennett to experiencing "five birthdays and ten Christmases at once." This moment underscores the enduring bonds of family and the strength found in human connection, even amidst adversity. While the Foremans' journey remains uncertain, the continued efforts to support them reflect the resilience and hope shared by loved ones across borders.</p><p>As these distinct yet interconnected narratives unfold, they remind us of the complexities and richness of our world. Whether through the ancient echoes of societies past, the contemporary challenges of political dynamics, or the enduring power of personal relationships, these stories inspire reflection and curiosity.

          <p>As our world embraces the warmth of connection and achievement, it too experiences moments of trials that call for resilience and reflection. Over the past week, various incidents around the globe offered a moment to ponder the complexities of human systems, technological reliance, and natural phenomena. With a focus on understanding and compassion, let us delve into these events with a calm and collective spirit.</p><p>In a sorrowful occurrence, a boat capsized off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden, resulting in the loss of numerous lives. The United Nations migration agency reported that out of 157 people onboard, 76 were confirmed deceased and 74 remain missing, leaving only 32 survivors. This incident, described as one of the deadliest this year in the region, once again shines a light on the challenges faced by migrants seeking better opportunities and the need for stronger safety measures and humanitarian assistance.</p><p>In Australia, a government IT system came under scrutiny as hundreds of jobseeker payments were unlawfully cancelled. The commonwealth ombudsman revealed that 964 individuals were impacted due to the targeted compliance framework's automated system operating outside the legal framework. This finding questions the balance between efficiency in public service and the necessity for human oversight, fostering discussions on ensuring support systems properly serve their intended purposes without unintended detriments.</p><p>The Himalayan region of India was not spared nature's unpredictability as a sudden flash flood tore through the town of Dharali in Uttarakhand state. A powerful torrent swept through the valley, dismantling buildings and tragically causing the death of at least four individuals while around 100 others are still missing. This natural disaster serves as a powerful reminder of the impacts of climate change, urging us to mitigate risks and strengthen community resilience in the face of environmental challenges.</p><p>Amid these external events, a tragedy unfolded within the walls of a psychiatric hospital in Berkshire, UK. An inquest revealed that a support worker, lacking the necessary experience and using a false identity, was employed in a setting critical for safeguarding vulnerable individuals. The death of 14-year-old Ruth Szymankiewicz in such circumstances underscores the importance of stringent hiring processes and thorough background checks, especially in environments where trust and security are paramount.</p><p>Each of these narratives extends a profound opportunity to practice empathy and evaluate our processes and responses. Whether addressing systemic flaws or responding to natural calamities, our collective human capacity to learn, adapt, and care leads gradually toward a more secure and nurturing future for all. As we reflect upon these events, we work towards fostering a world where compassion meets action, assuring safety, dignity, and hope across communities worldwide.</p>

The death of 14-year-old Ruth Szymankiewicz in such circumstances underscores the importance of stringent hiring processes and thorough background checks, especially in environments where trust and security are paramount.</p><p>Each of these narratives extends a profound opportunity to practice empathy and evaluate our processes and responses. Whether addressing systemic flaws or responding to natural calamities, our collective human capacity to learn, adapt, and care leads gradually toward a more secure and nurturing future for all. As we reflect upon these events, we work towards fostering a world where compassion meets action, assuring safety, dignity, and hope across communities worldwide.</p>

          <p>In a diverse array of political and economic developments across the globe, several nation-states are engaging in pivotal actions that will likely influence their internal dynamics and international relations. The following segments provide an overview of these significant events, illustrating the complexities and decisions shaping our world.</p><p>In France, Prime Minister François Bayrou has turned to YouTube in a strategic effort to publicize and gain approval for upcoming budget cuts. These measures, described as "draconian," are aimed at addressing fiscal challenges. The digital platform serves as a modern avenue for direct communication with the public, permitting an open dialogue about the rationale and expected outcomes of these stringent financial decisions. By embracing this approach, the Prime Minister hopes to foster understanding and support among French citizens.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe, a noteworthy legal decision has emerged from Moldova, where pro-Russian politician Evghenia Gutul has been sentenced to seven years in prison. The charges relate to illegal party financing, amidst escalating concerns of foreign influence on the nation’s electoral process. This ruling reinforces Moldova's stance against unauthorized foreign interference, particularly ahead of its impending elections, marking a firm stance in the region's political landscape.</p><p>In a different sphere of international politics, former U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated that he will "probably not" seek a third term in office. Given constitutional restrictions, this statement aligns with legal stipulations, yet offers clarity on the political aspirations of the influential figure. This development adds an element of predictability amidst the often unpredictable nature of political careers.</p><p>Drawing attention to Brazil, the U.S. has expressed disapproval over a Brazilian Supreme Court decision placing former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest. Bolsonaro, accused of plotting a coup, allegedly breached conditions imposed during his trial proceedings. The U.S. State Department's public endorsement of Bolsonaro highlights ongoing diplomatic engagements and the complex nature of international legal observations.</p><p>In South America, Argentine President Javier Milei has sparked discussions by vetoing bills aimed at increasing pensions and disability benefits. His justification focusses on fiscal prudence, aiming to preserve the government's economic stability. Despite facing opposition from advocacy groups, these actions reflect the ongoing balancing act between social welfare and fiscal responsibility.</p><p>Returning to Europe, a wave of revisions in political resumes among Spanish politicians has occurred following admissions of inaccuracies in educational qualifications. This transparency movement, initially set off by a People's Party member, serves as a catalyst for accountability in public service.</p><p>In the field of technology and governance, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has faced criticism for incorporating AI tools into his decision-making process. While some experts have voiced concerns, Kristersson's approach exemplifies the integration of cutting-edge technology within governmental operations, sparking dialogue on artificial intelligence's role in leadership.</p><p>In Asia, India's energy strategies face a diplomatic challenge as Donald Trump calls for cessation of Russian oil imports. The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, must navigate between economic advantages and international pressure, spotlighting India’s policy of non-alignment amidst shifting geopolitical landscapes.</p><p>Finally, amid preparations for heightened activity in English prisons due to anticipated protests, authorities are adjusting to manage potential strain on the penal system. This preemptive measure underscores the importance of maintaining public order and the complexity of managing civil demonstrations.</p><p>Throughout these global updates, a common thread emerges: nations are continuously adapting to both internal demands and external pressures. Each decision and policy mentioned herein contributes to the intricate tapestry of international relations and domestic governance, reflecting the ever-evolving nature of the global political arena.</p>
