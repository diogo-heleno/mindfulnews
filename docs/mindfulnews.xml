      <description><![CDATA[**Headline:** Victoria’s Liberal Leader Anticipates Positive Progress for Party Amid Pesutto Loan Decision

**Summary:** 

The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) has introduced new regulations aimed at improving energy deals for consumers. These include limiting energy retailers to one price increase per year and eliminating fees for vulnerable customers. While these rules do not change the base cost of energy, they offer consumers more transparency and choice. The reforms ensure that customers won't face higher charges for their loyalty or excessive late payment penalties. Vulnerable individuals will benefit from fee exemptions, while others will see fees limited to reasonable levels. Overall, these changes aim to provide Australians with increased confidence and support in managing their energy plans.]]></description>
