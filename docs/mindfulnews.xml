      <description><![CDATA[**Headline:** Updates on Australians Departing Israel and New Energy Market Rules

**Summary:** 

A small number of Australians have successfully left Israel via a land crossing, with nearly 3,000 passport holders still seeking assistance to leave the area. Additionally, the Australian Energy Market Commission announced significant updates to energy pricing rules. These updates are designed to provide clearer information and better support for consumers, including:

- Prohibiting prices from being raised more than once a year in most cases.
- Ensuring consumers are not charged more than the standing offer price if their energy plan changes or expires.
- Removing excessive penalties for late bill payments.
- Eliminating fees for vulnerable customers and ensuring fees for others are limited to reasonable costs.

These reforms aim to support Australian households in making informed energy choices and provide better protection for those facing financial challenges.]]></description>
