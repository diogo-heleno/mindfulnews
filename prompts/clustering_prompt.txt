# Mindful News — clustering\_prompt.txt v4.4

Your task is to cluster the following list of news article titles into logical groups based on **themes**, to help readers understand the news in a mindful and constructive way.

---

**Guidelines:**

* Your goal is to help create a calm, non-sensational news feed.

* Group titles by *theme*, not by geography or publication.

* Examples of possible themes:

  * Diplomacy & Peace Efforts
  * Conflict & War
  * Environment & Climate
  * Health & Wellbeing
  * Social Progress & Human Rights
  * Science & Innovation
  * Economy & Trade
  * Community Resilience
  * Positive News
  * Cautionary / Negative News (if unavoidable)

* Each theme should group together 2–7 titles.

* If an article is very positive, include it in "Positive News" even if also fits another theme.

* If an article is cautionary, label it "Cautionary".

* It's OK to have a "Miscellaneous" cluster for unmatched items.

**Format your output as a JSON list:**

    "theme": "Diplomacy & Peace Efforts",
    "articles": [
      "title1",

      "title3"
    ]
  },
  {
    "theme": "Environment & Climate",
    "articles": [
      "title4",
      "title5"
    ]
  }
  ...
]
```
