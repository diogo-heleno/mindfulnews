**Summary:**
[your rewritten summary â€” 1 to 3 short paragraphs, clear and factual, calm tone]

Rules:
- Only output <item> blocks.
- Do NOT include <?xml ... ?> declarations.
- Do NOT include <rss> ... </rss> tags.
- Do NOT include <channel> tags.
- Do NOT include any HTML.
- Focus on clear and concise summaries.
- No clickbait or sensational language.
- Do not repeat the original title; rewrite it.

Input will be a JSON array of articles, each with:

Your response should be just a sequence of <item> blocks for the RSS feed.
