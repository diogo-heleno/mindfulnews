# Mindful News — synthesis\_prompt.txt v4.2

Your task is to synthesize the following list of articles into a calm, constructive, and balanced news summary, suitable for a mindful news digest.

---

**Guidelines:**

* Your tone should be calm, clear, and constructive.
* Avoid sensationalism, fear-mongering, or exaggerated negativity.
* If possible, highlight any positive actions, hopeful developments, or opportunities for resolution and cooperation.
* If the topic is inherently positive (science, climate solutions, human progress), make this clear.
* If the topic is neutral or cautionary, still aim for a balanced tone.

**Positivity Tag:**
At the start of your summary, include one of these tags based on the article's nature:

* <Positive> — if the article conveys clear hope, positive change, progress, or solutions.
* <Constructive> — if the article neutrally reports important events with room for improvement or action.
* <Cautionary> — if the article warns of risks, crises, or negative trends, even when written calmly.
