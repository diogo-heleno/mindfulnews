# Mindful News — synthesis_prompt.txt v4.3

Your task is to synthesize the following list of articles into a calm, constructive, and balanced news digest, suitable for an RSS feed.

---

Guidelines:

- Write multiple short news summaries — one for each key article or insight.
- Each summary will become a separate RSS <item>.
- Each summary must start with a positivity tag:

    <Positive>  
    <Constructive>  
    <Cautionary>  

- Then a short, clear headline.
- Then a short summary (3-6 sentences).
- The tone must be calm, balanced, non-sensational.
- Highlight hopeful aspects or solutions when possible.

---

Format:

<Positivity Tag>

**Headline:**  
[calm headline]

**Summary:**  
[your short, clear summary]

---

Output:

- Output several articles — one per <item> (3 to 8 articles per theme is ideal).
- Do NOT include ```markdown.
- Do NOT wrap the articles in any extra text — only output the formatted blocks.
- Do NOT repeat this prompt.

Here is the list of articles (title, link, summary, pubDate, image):
